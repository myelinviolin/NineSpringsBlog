Are you worried about flooding in Madison? Is your community prepared to handle flooding in the future?

You are invited to participate in a study by The Water Systems and Society research group at UW-Madison! Our study is focused on learning about flooding across neighborhoods in Madison, WI, with special interest in understanding the experiences of socially vulnerable communities. We invite all 18+ year old residents of Madison to participate. You will be asked to complete a survey to help us learn more about flooding and water management in your neighborhood. You may also elect to participate in an interview for us to learn more about flooding in your neighborhood and your personal experiences. If you choose to participate, you are eligible to receive a summary of research findings if interested. Email the research team to ask how.
