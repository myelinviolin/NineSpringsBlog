# [FAQs](https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/routes-schedules/bus-rapid-transit/frequently-asked-questions)

### **What is Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)?**

[Bus rapid transit (BRT)](https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/routes-schedules/bus-rapid-transit) is a frequent, faster, and more reliable bus system that uses larger buses to transport more riders. BRT’s features include frequent all-day service and direct routes with fewer stops.

It utilizes [special traffic signals](https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/routes-schedules/bus-rapid-transit/east-west-brt-line/what-are-queue-jumps) to help buses get through intersections faster, [dedicated bus lanes](https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/routes-schedules/bus-rapid-transit/bus-only-traffic-lanes), and stations with [off-board fare payment kiosks](https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/fares/station-ticket-machines).

### **Why do we need BRT?**

Metro Transit currently offers leading ridership nationally, providing 13 million rides each year on 62 routes with 218 buses. However, by the year 2050, Madison anticipates 85,000 new jobs, 100,000 new residents, and nearly 800,000 new road trips to work, school, and recreation.\

Adding BRT into the Metro Transit system will help alleviate passenger overcrowding on the buses, improve travel times throughout the City and simplify the system—to make taking the bus easier and better—helping to prepare for the expected increase in public transit demand over time.

# [Navigating Madison’s New Bus-Only Lanes (for Car Drivers)](https://www.cityofmadison.com/news/2024-08-22/navigating-madisons-new-bus-only-lanes)

There are now clearly marked lanes where only buses are allowed to travel along BRT roadways, or Metro's Rapid Route A line. Markings include bright red concrete, red and white lines, BUS ONLY street lettering, and posted signage.

Some dedicated lanes are in the far right side of the street, like the example above, but some are in the far left and service stations that are in the median of the roadway. If the lane is bright red or has a solid red line, it is BUS ONLY and regular motorist are not allowed to use.
