## New Neighborhoods Interactive Map, a New Multi-Use Path Bridge, 2025 Neighborhood Grant Program and More!

### The Neighborhoods Website Has a Fresh New Look! 

Thanks to the collaborative efforts of City IT and Planning GIS specialists, the Planning Division has launched a revamped Neighborhood Organizations website featuring an interactive map. This updated platform makes it easier for City staff to manage neighborhood contact information and enhance communication.

The [interactive map](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/f78d7cf051594a4b8ed2b047104b8b0d/#data_s=id%3AdataSource_2-19241b03384-layer-5%3A209) highlights active neighborhood organizations throughout Madison. Simply click on a neighborhood shape to access detailed information about association contacts, meetings, and newsletters. Explore the new site and discover how we're improving connections within our community!

### Autumn Ridge the City's newest multi-use path 

Did you know that there is a new bike and pedestrian bridge located at 4346 Commercial Avenue?

The Autumn Ridge Path will create a shared-use path connection between Milwaukee St. and Commercial Ave. (north of Highway 30), including a new bridge over Highway 30. The project will improve safety and accessibility for non-motorized modes of transportation to cross Highway 30, better connecting neighborhoods on either side of the highway. You can participate in the [ribbon-cutting](https://www.cityofmadison.com/news/2024-12-12/rescheduled-city-invites-public-to-celebrate-its-new-autumn-ridge-path) on 8:30 a.m., Tuesday, 12/17/2024.

### Help Shape the Future of South Stoughton Road! 

WisDOT is studying potential improvements for South Stoughton Road (US 51), and your input is needed! As a key stakeholder in the study, the City of Madison's goals for the corridor include better balancing the needs and safety of all users, enhancing community connectivity, and ensuring the redesign supports both current and future land use opportunities in the area.

[Learn more about the study](https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/projects/by-region/sw/us51-corridor/southstudy.aspx) and [take the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/US51SPIM2), open through December 20.

Your feedback will help shape a corridor that meets the needs of our community. Next steps will refine options under consideration and identify a preferred design---don't miss this opportunity to share your voice!

### 2025 Neighborhood Grant Program 

The Planning Division will once again offer small grants to neighborhood groups, small groups of residents, business associations and other eligible organizations for neighborhood improvement projects. Grant guidelines and application materials will be ready soon and will be posted to the City's webpage in the next couple of weeks. For now, you could consider saving the date for the Neighborhood Grant Program workshop. This workshop is not required, but provides an overview of the program and time for you to share your project and ask questions of staff and other neighborhood folks.

There will be two meeting options on Thursday January 9, 2025. The first will be a virtual option at 12:00 p.m. You must [register here](https://cityofmadison.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZwtd-GrqDgtHtPhqpyvmZypwUHXdfis3U-W) and you will receive a reminder and meeting link. You could also attend in-person at 6:00 p.m. in the Madison Municipal Building, 215 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Room 151, 53701.

### Streets Division Updates

-   **Large Item Collection is Changing Soon:** As a reminder, in 2025 large item collection will end for properties over 8 units. Larger complexes can still use the drop-off sites, but curbside pickup will no longer be available. More details can be had at [www.cityofmadison.com/LargeItem](www.cityofmadison.com/LargeItem).

-   **Drop-off Sites Hours Changed:** The drop-off sites are now on shortened winter hours, so please plan accordingly. Only the South Point Rd. and Sycamore Ave. drop-off sites are available in the winter, and the hours are reduced because we do not have the seasonal staff to help provide extended hours. Make sure you know the hours and locations before you load your car by going to [www.cityofmadison.com/DropOffSites](www.cityofmadison.com/DropOffSites).

-   **Recycle Your Batteries:** With the holiday season comes plenty of new battery-powered gadgets, so be sure you are recycling them the right way. We have a website, and a new video, to help you understand what to do with all of these potentially dangerous things in all those amazing electronics. [Here's the link you need](https://www.cityofmadison.com/streets/trash-recycling/how-do-i-dispose-of/household-batteries).

-   **Holiday Recycling Questions?** Try the New Online Recyclopedia: The new tool is available on [the "How do I dispose of...?" page](https://www.cityofmadison.com/streets/trash-recycling/how-do-i-dispose-of), and also many other spots throughout the Streets website. If you're stumped on how to handle something like those holiday lights that burnt out on you, or your favor ugly Christmas sweater that has a hole in it you can't repair -- then please check out the online tool as it will give you the correct advice.
