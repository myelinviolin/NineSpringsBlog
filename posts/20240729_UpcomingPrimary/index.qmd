This election will serve as a primary for the upcoming Senate race, Congressional race, and the Dane County Executive election later this year. There are also two proposed amendments to the state Constitution related to the administration of federal funds.

The Isthmus put together a great primer along with links to discussions of the various candidates and amendments along with information about registration and voting options: [Isthmus Voter Guide](https://isthmus.com/news/news/2024-isthmus-august-primary-voter-guide/)
