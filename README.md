# NineSpringsBlog

This is an open source website for the South Madison, Wisconsin area, specifically for the Nine Springs Neighborhood, formally known as the Indian Springs Neighborhood. It is designed to provide resources, events, and blog posts as a replacement for a neighborhood newsletter. A newsletter comes out quarterly and the information is lost in subsequent editions, whereas a website serves as an ongoing collection of information and provides real-time updates to the community.

The website is hosted on QuartoPub, and contains embedded Shiny applications that are hosted separately at shinyapps.io. There is not yet a way to make a push to the repository automatically republish the website, so it needs to be done manually in order to reflect the changes on the website.
