#### Local Neighborhood Events

We try to keep these events close by, virtual, and free or very low cost to keep them accessible for the majority of people. Some, like the Neighborhood Meetings and Coffee Meetups, are hosted by us, and others, like the Community Dinners and the Stuff Swaps, are hosted by other groups.
