Scheduled for construction in summer/fall 2026 Together, these two
projects are 1.38 miles extending from McCoy Road to CTH MC (John Nolan
Drive). These projects do not include any work being completed to the
bridge over USH 12/18.

The purpose of the proposed improvements to the CTH MM (Rimrock Road)
segment is to enhance the safety, accessibility, and efficiency of the
corridor for all users, including drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists.
The existing roadway is experiencing significant cracking, which leads
to a poor ride quality for drivers. Additionally, many elements of the
infrastructure are not in compliance with current standards, including
curb ramps and bus pads that do not meet Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) requirements and outdated beam guard and traffic signals that fail
to conform to updated safety standards.

**The proposed improvement includes:**

-   Replacing the full depth of the pavement along the roadway.

-   Making repairs to curb & gutter and sidewalks as needed.

-   Constructing a new multi-use path on the west side of the road from
    US 12/18 to County MC (John Nolan Drive).

-   Replacing traffic signals and beam guard to meet new standards.

-   Upgrading curb ramps to meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
    standards.

-   Making necessary repairs to the storm sewer system to support curb
    ramp improvements.

-   Connecting sidewalk along the east side of the roadway at the bridge
    over the belt line.

-   Improving the entrance to the Alliant Energy Center Campus.

-   Traffic Control

Preliminary plans are to complete this work under two phases to help
keep the roadway open at all times to allow access for local residents,
businesses, emergency services and commuting traffic. More details on
the traffic control plan will be shared as the design for this project
develops.
