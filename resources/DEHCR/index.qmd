The Division of Energy, Housing and Community Resources (DEHCR) offers a
broad range of program assistance and resources to address homelessness
and support affordable housing, public infrastructure, household energy
needs, and economic development opportunities. The Division partners
with local governments and service providers, non-profit agencies,
housing authorities, and developers.

The [**Energy**](https://energyandhousing.wi.gov/Pages/Energy.aspx) programs
(Home Energy Plus / HE+) help eligible households with electric and
heating costs, energy-efficiency improvements, and HVAC/water-heater
repairs or replacements.

The [**Housing**](https://energyandhousing.wi.gov/Pages/Housing.aspx) programs
provide funding for homeless and special-needs services, plus rental
assistance, home-purchase assistance, and home rehabilitation.

[**Community
Resources**](https://energyandhousing.wi.gov/Pages/CommunityResources.aspx) grants
support eligible local governments (towns, villages, cities, counties)
for public-infrastructure improvements, blight elimination, business
development, and disaster-recovery assistance.
