### Our Mission

## <span style="color: green">Food, resources and faith to build a stronger community</span>

### Our Vision

## <span style="color: green">A fully nourished community</span>

### About Us 

The River is South Central Wisconsin's busiest food pantry. Services include free groceries for pickup or delivery, to-go meals, online grocery orders, mobile meals, and after-hours food lockers. The River also recovers food and resources---that would otherwise go to waste---from local retailers. Since 2006, The River has grown to serve over 3,500 people every week in pursuit of its vision: a fully nourished community.
